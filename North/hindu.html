		<p>Hindu College is now a constituent college of the University of Delhi in Delhi, India. Established in 1899 [initially, at Kinari Bazar (Chandni Chowk, Delhi), later shifted to Kashmiri Gate (Delhi) and then to its present site in Delhi University (North Campus)], it is one of the oldest and most preferred colleges in Delhi. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in sciences, humanities, social sciences and commerce.
		</p>
		<p>
		Nationally, it is ranked 2nd in 2019 by National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) under Ministry of Human Resource Development (Government of India). It is awarded 'Star College' status for its Department of Biotechnology by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Government of India).
		</p>
		<p>
			The College has produced many notable (infra) alumni in the fields of law, economics, science, psychology, business, literature, media, cinema, military and politics. Notwithstanding its name, students from all religions are admitted to Hindu College.
			The college has a 25-acre campus. It also has one auditorium and a seminar room. The college maintains a playground and a sports complex. Basketball, cricket, and table tennis are organised under the supervision of the Director of Physical Education. The college has physics and chemistry laboratories, NCC and NSS rooms. A computer room, photocopier and stationery shop are also available. A Students' Centre offers a bank and a canteen.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Hindu College's boys hostel is situated next to the sports complex of college. It is a structure with 119 rooms enclosing four lawns with rose beds and hedges (charbagh style). The hostel provides residential facilities to about two hundred undergraduate and postgraduate male students. A common room provides the residents recreational facilities such as carrom-board, chess, and a separate TV room apart from the newspapers and magazines. Due to its limited capacity, only the highly meritorious among the college students get admission to the hostel. The college plans to have a girls hostel, which has been delayed due to procedural delays.

So far, such Innovation projects have directly involved 150 students in research and have received Rs. 93 lakhs in total across different departments to conduct their collaborative research. 

			The College has been granted 15 Innovation Research Projects funded by the University of Delhi. Innovation projects are an excellent platform for the students to interact with students from other departments and to enhance their research abilities and promote interdisciplinary research. 10 students and 3-5 faculty members are involved in each project.
